Ammeter information
An ammeter /ˈamɪtə/ (abbreviation of Ampere meter) is a measuring instrument used to measure the 
current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in Amperes (A), hence the name. The ammeter is 
usually connected in series with the circuit in which the current is to be measured. An ammeter 
usually has low resistance so that it does not cause a significant voltage drop in the circuit being 
measured.

Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated 
as milliammeters or microammeters. Early ammeters were laboratory instruments that relied on the 
Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed 
which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems. 
It is generally represented by letter 'A' in a circuit.
