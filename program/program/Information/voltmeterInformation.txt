A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electric tension in a circuit. It is connected in parallel. It usually has a high resistance so that it takes negligible current from the circuit.

voltage/electric tension - the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points.

symbol - U
unit - volts (V)
formulas - U = I.R
